# CS2600-Final
Essentially your time at CPP is designed to help you succeed when you enter the real world as a 
developer. To do this, you must expand your knowledge beyond what you have been taught. This final 
will mimic that experience by allowing you to make programs that we have been using in this class from 
scratch and understand how it all comes together. 

## PART 1 
Create a Shell in C by stepping through the tutorial. I suggest you read and follow each step and make 
corrections if there are any. https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/

## PART 2
Create a text editor by stepping through the tutorial, https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/. This 
is about a 1000 lines of code. The average developer writes about 100 lines of code a day. I suggest you 
start as soon as possible!
